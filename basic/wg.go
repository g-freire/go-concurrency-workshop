WAIT GROUPS
Wait groups  are more cost efficient than sleep (waits only the necessary time),
Next example show goroutines within a anonymous function using waiting groups
to syncronize the main goroutine with the scheduled ones.
Is interesting to note that concurrent application does not guarantee the order of execution,
the OS manages the threads priorities.
